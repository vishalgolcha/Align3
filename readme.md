### HOW CAN YOU WIN THE GAME ?

>The two players take turn one by one and strategically place their coins to win. The player who achieves the alignment of the three coins wins while the alignment can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal. 

>A single alignment of three coins in anydirection by a player terminates the game. In this game, the coins never move once placed. If no playercan achieve an alignment of three coins and all 8 coins of both players are consumed, then the game is a draw.
